## 📋 What You Need (Shopping List)

### Hardware (Physical Things You Can Touch)
- **KC705 Evaluation Board** (~$2000) - This is your "smart chip" board
- **Computer** (Windows/Linux/Mac) - Your regular computer  
- **PCIe Cable** (comes with KC705) - Think of this like a USB cable but faster
- **Power Supply** (comes with KC705) - Plugs into wall to power the board

## 🏗️ The Big Picture (What We're Building)

```
Your Computer → KC705 Board → AI Results
     ↓              ↓             ↓
   Photos        Smart Chip    "This is a cat!"
```

**Simple Explanation:**
1. You give it a photo of a cat
2. KC705 processes it super fast (like a tiny AI brain)
3. It tells you "This is a cat with 95% confidence"

---

## 📚 PART 1: Understanding the Process

### What is an FPGA? 
Think of it like **LEGO blocks for computer circuits**. You can rebuild the "brain" inside to do different tasks. Today we're building an AI brain that recognizes pictures.

### What is Vivado?
It's like **"Photoshop for computer chips"**. Just like Photoshop edits photos, Vivado edits the "brain pattern" inside the FPGA chip.

### What is a Driver?
Think of it like a **translator**. Your computer speaks "Computer language" and the KC705 speaks "Chip language". The driver translates between them.

## 🔧 PART 2: Step-by-Step Setup (The Easy Way)

### Step 1: Physical Setup (5 minutes)
**What you're doing:** Connecting everything like setting up a gaming console

```
1. 📦 Unbox your KC705 board
2. 🔌 Plug power adapter into KC705 → wall outlet
3. 💻 Connect USB cable: KC705 → your computer
4. 🚀 Connect PCIe cable: KC705 → your computer's PCIe slot*
5. 💡 Turn on KC705 (power switch)
```

*PCIe slot = Those long slots inside your desktop computer where graphics cards go

**What should happen:** 
- Green lights turn on
- Your computer makes a "new device" sound
- KC705 shows up in Device Manager (Windows)

---

### Step 2: Install Vivado (30 minutes)
**What you're doing:** Installing the "Photoshop for chips" software

```
1. 🌐 Go to xilinx.com
2. 📥 Download "Vivado ML Edition" (Free version)
   - Size: ~40 GB (yes, it's huge!)
   - Time: 1-3 hours depending on internet
3. 🚀 Run installer
4. ✅ Choose "Standard Installation"
5. ☕ Wait (seriously, get coffee)
```

**Why it's so big:** Vivado contains templates for thousands of different chips, like having every LEGO set instruction manual ever made.

### Step 3: Get the MobileNetV3 "Brain Pattern" (10 minutes)
**What you're doing:** Downloading the AI brain design

```
Option A: Use our pre-made design
1. 📁 Download our complete project files
2. 📂 Extract to: C:\KC705_MobileNetV3\

Option B: Build from scratch (Advanced)
1. 💻 Open Vivado
2. 📋 Create new project
3. 📝 Add our Verilog files
4. ⚙️ Run synthesis + implementation
```

**Think of it like:** Downloading an app vs. programming an app from scratch

---

### Step 4: "Flash" the FPGA (15 minutes)
**What you're doing:** Installing the AI brain onto the chip

```
1. 💻 Open Vivado
2. 📁 Open project: C:\KC705_MobileNetV3\KC705_MobileNetV3.xpr
3. ⚡ Click "Generate Bitstream" 
   - This creates the "brain pattern" file
   - Takes 10-30 minutes
   - Your computer will sound like a jet engine (normal!)
4. 📤 Click "Program Device"
5. 🎯 Select KC705
6. ✅ Click "Program"
```

**What's happening:** 
- Vivado is creating a ".bit" file (the brain pattern)
- Then copying this pattern onto the FPGA chip
- Like burning a CD, but for computer chips

**Success signs:**
- "Programming successful" message
- KC705 LEDs change pattern
- No error messages

# Type: cat.jpg
# Expected: "Predicted: Egyptian cat (87.5% confidence)"
```

### Test 3: Batch Processing
```bash
# Classify multiple photos
./bin/kc705_examples --batch /path/to/photo/folder

## 🔧 PART 4: Understanding What Happens Inside

### The Journey of One Photo

```
1. 📷 You: "Here's a photo of my cat"
   
2. 💻 Computer: "Let me send this to KC705..."
   → Converts photo to numbers (pixels)
   → Sends via PCIe (super fast highway)

3. 🧠 KC705: "Analyzing..."
   → Input layer: Looks at pixels
   → Hidden layers: Finds patterns (whiskers, ears, fur)
   → Output layer: "This looks like a cat!"
   → Processing time: 15-25 milliseconds (blink of an eye!)

4. 📤 KC705: "Done! Sending results back..."
   → Sends answer via PCIe

5. 💻 Computer: "The KC705 says this is a cat with 87% confidence"

6. 👀 You: "Wow, that was fast and accurate!"
```

### Why KC705 is So Fast
- **Parallel Processing**: Like having 1000 tiny calculators working together
- **Dedicated Hardware**: Built specifically for AI (not general computing)
- **No Operating System Overhead**: Direct hardware access
- **High-Speed Memory**: Data moves super fast inside the chip
